        this class inherits from tf.keras.Model
        a general class of policy gradient RL agents using actor-critic
        assume this agent can manage num_stocks stocks at the same time, and the agent's actions have no impact on
        the stock environment. When performing each action, assume the agent can only sell/buy/hold one of the
        num_stocks stocks.

        (outdated, don't read, kept for documentation purpose)
        # the agent's action space is a tensor of size [3 * num_stocks], where indexes [3i, 3i+1, 3i+2] refers to the
        # i-th stock (zero-indexing). Each element of this tensor is in [0, 1] and all elements should sum up to 1 (this
        # tensor is a probability of taking each action). For the i-th stock, action[3i] is the probability of holding,
        # action[3i+1] is the probability of buying, action[3i+2] is the probability of selling.
        # To choose an action, we sample from this probability tensor and get an index k. if (k mod 3) == 0, then the
        # agent will do nothing. if (k mod 3) == 1, then the agent will buy (action[k] * self.max_buy) amount of the
        # corresponding stock. If (k mod 3) == 2, then the agent will sell (action[k] * self.max_sell) amount of the
        # corresponding stock.
